# Musicus

## About
An offline music player targeting Android 14. I decided to make this since I don't want to pay for Spotify, but Samsung Music doesn't support lyrics. I wasn't quite satisfied with the other apps I saw, either. It might seem like a bit of a petty reason, but I needed something to kill time anyways. I learnt Kotlin and Jetpack Compose just for this so it better end up working.

## Features
 - Samsung Music-inspired theme and design (too lazy to do design).
 - Up to three lyrics files per track, for original, romanised, and translated lyrics.
 - Support for plaintext, LRC (timed lines) and Enhanced LRC (timed words) formats.
 - Custom markdown features for lyrics, providing QoL features.
 - Search in any combination of metadata tags.
 - Cleave playlists in twain.
 - Completely free (I don't know how to do finance stuff anyways).
